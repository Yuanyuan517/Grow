During working, I need to generate random numbers from uniform distributions. However, I have forgotten the knowledge, so I had a quick review and recorded some brief notes here (wikipedia is highly dependent study resource):

-    Probability density function (PDF), or a density of a continuous random variable, the PDF is used to specify the probability of the random variable falling within a particular range of values, as opposed to taking on any one value. This probability is given by the integral of this variable's PDF over that range—that is, it is given by the area under the density function but above the horizontal axis and between the lowest and greatest values of the range. The probability density function is nonnegative everywhere, and its integral over the entire space is equal to one. 最简单的概率密度/分布函数是均匀分布的密度函数(uniform distribution), 是对于一个取值在区间上的均匀分布函数，正态分布的概率密度函数，正态分布(normal distribution)是重要的概率分布。
- To generate random number from java, Random class in java itself already uses uniform distribution
The code listed following is the source code related to the method nextInt(). The details should be studied.

```java
/**
     * Creates a new random number generator. This constructor sets
     * the seed of the random number generator to a value very likely
     * to be distinct from any other invocation of this constructor.
     */
    public Random() {
        this(seedUniquifier() ^ System.nanoTime());
    }

private static long seedUniquifier() {
        // L'Ecuyer, "Tables of Linear Congruential Generators of
        // Different Sizes and Good Lattice Structure", 1999
        for (;;) {
            long current = seedUniquifier.get();
            long next = current * 181783497276652981L;
            if (seedUniquifier.compareAndSet(current, next))
                return next;
        }
    }

    private static final AtomicLong seedUniquifier
        = new AtomicLong(8682522807148012L);

     * <p>The hedge "approximately" is used in the foregoing description only

     * chosen bits, then the algorithm shown would choose {@code int}
     * values from the stated range with perfect uniformity.
     * <p>
     * The algorithm is slightly tricky.  It rejects values that would result
     * in an uneven distribution (due to the fact that 2^31 is not divisible
     * by n). The probability of a value being rejected depends on n.  The
     * worst case is n=2^30+1, for which the probability of a reject is 1/2,
     * and the expected number of iterations before the loop terminates is 2.
     * <p>
     * The algorithm treats the case where n is a power of two specially: it
     * returns the correct number of high-order bits from the underlying
     * pseudo-random number generator.  In the absence of special treatment,
     * the correct number of <i>low-order</i> bits would be returned.  Linear
     * congruential pseudo-random number generators such as the one
     * implemented by this class are known to have short periods in the
     * sequence of values of their low-order bits.  Thus, this special case
     * greatly increases the length of the sequence of values returned by
     * successive calls to this method if n is a small power of two.

Another review is about instance variables and instance methods in java:
Instance variables and instance methods are what we have been calling "non-static variables" and "non-static subroutines." That is, they are variables and subroutines that are declared in a class but are not marked as "static." When a class is loaded into the computer, instance variables and methods do not become part of the class in memory; instead, they become part of each object that is constructed from that class, and each object gets its own copy of the instance variables and methods.
