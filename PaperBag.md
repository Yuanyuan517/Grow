Title: Dynamic Software Project Scheduling through a Proactive-Rescheduling Method   
Author: Xiaoning Shen, Leandro L. Minku, Member, IEEE, Rami Bahsoon, and Xin Yao, Fellow, IEEE    
Summary: this paper formulates the project scheduling problem by considering uncertainties and dynamic  
events that often occur during software project development, and constructs a mathematical model for the   
resulting multi-objective dynamic project scheduling problem (MODPSP), where the four objectives of project  
cost, duration, robustness and stability are considered simultaneously under a variety of practical constraints.  
In order to solve MODPSP appropriately, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based proactive-rescheduling   
method is proposed, which generates a robust schedule predictively and adapts the previous schedule in response   
to critical dynamic events during the project execution.</br>
